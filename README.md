# WideOpenTechClone
This is a clone of the popular WideOpenTech.com website. I enjoyed cloning this site which took me a 2 days. Built with HTML and CSS. No Javascript. No Libraries. Used media queries for mobile responsiveness. I used flex and tried to limit using flex so I can focus more on positioning using css.
